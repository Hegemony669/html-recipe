    <li>For the Chocolate Frosting: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>    
            <li>3 cups powdered sugar</li>

<h2 class="lists2">Instructions: </h2>
<ol class="lists2">
    <li>For the Cake:
       <ul>
          <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to combine.</li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract.</li>
          <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until the batter is smooth and well combined.</li>
          <li>Pour in the boiling water and stir until the batter is thin. Don't worry; it will be quite runny. This helps create a moist cake.</li>
          <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
          <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
       </ul><br />
    </li>   
    
    
    <li>For the Chocolate Frosting: 
        <ul><li>In a large bowl, sift the cocoa powder to remove any lumps</li>
            <li>In another bowl, beat the softened butter until it's creamy and smooth.</li> 
            <li>Gradually add the sifted cocoa powder and powdered sugar to the butter, alternating with the milk, while continuing to beat the mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, and continue to beat until the frosting is smooth and well combined. If the frosting is too thick, you can add a bit more milk to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
        </ul><br />
    </li>    
    
    
    <li>Assembling the Cake: 
        <ul>
            <li>Once the cake layers are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate or cake stand.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of chocolate frosting evenly over the top of the first cake layer.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the second cake layer on top.</li>
            <li>Frost the top and sides of the entire cake with the remaining chocolate frosting. You can use an offset spatula for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Decorate the cake as desired. You can use chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or extra cocoa powder for decoration.</li>
            <li>Slice and enjoy your homemade chocolate cake!</li>
        </ul><br /> 
    </li>
